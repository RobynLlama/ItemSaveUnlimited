# ItemSaveUnlimited

A simple mod that allows configuring the maximum number of saved props (wands, ingredients, potions, etc) in a save game. The game's default setting is 50 and long running saves will eventually start suffering from disappearing items without this mod

## Save Safety

This should be safe to add or remove mid-save. Keep in mind that removing this mod from an existing save with more than 50 items will cause some of them to disappear next time the game is saved and then loaded since items above the 50 count will be discarded by the save system

## Note on Config Managers

ItemSaveUnlimited intentionally makes itself incompatible with in-game config managers, please edit your config in your mod manager before launching the game, thank you.
